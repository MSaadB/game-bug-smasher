A simple Bug Smasher browser-based (HTML5 canvas) game.

Features:
The bug hops randomly around the game area at a given interval. The player tries to catch the bug by clicking on it. 
If they succeeds, the score is incremented and the hopping interval is decremented by a number of milliseconds, so it gets harder to catch the bug.
If the game becomes too challenging, the player can reset the speed to the initial hopping interval by clicking the Reset Speed button.
If the player wants, they can start again by resetting the score by clicking the Reset Score button.
